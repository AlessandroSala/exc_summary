\section{Introduction}
The theoretical study of atomic nuclei provides a bridge between nuclear physics and nuclear engineering. Starting from a framework consistent with quantum mechanics, the strong interaction, and its underlying symmetries, modern nuclear theory aims to construct models characterised by a limited number of free parameters and capable of predicting both nuclear structure and reactions, across a wide range of systems. While experimental data have long provided invaluable insight into nuclear properties and processes, only a coherent theoretical description allows for systematic extrapolations towards regions of the nuclear chart or physical conditions that remain beyond current experimental reach, thus playing an essential role in applications relevant to nuclear engineering.

In particular, nuclear fission, despite its massive importance in nuclear engineering, remains only partially understood from a microscopic standpoint. Current models that use empirical approaches successfully reproduce global quantities like fission barrier heights, fragment mass distributions, and average neutron multiplicities for well studied nuclei. However, these models may rely on a huge number of parameters, which limit their predictive power when extrapolated to systems which are less investigated experimentally. A fully microscopic understanding of the collective dynamics leading from the compound nucleus to scission, the treatment of quantum many-body correlations, and the description of fragment excitation and emission remain among the major open challenges, particularly relevant for the simulation of next-generation reactors, which require the accurate description of nuclei and fuel materials -- far less explored than those employed in traditional thermal systems -- to be correctly predicted. 

\subsection{Microscopic description of nuclei}
In this regard, the approach to the microscopic description of nuclei, is the one of the many-body theory, which starting from the interacting nucleons, aims at building a complete description of the nucleus. The use of phenomenological potentials based on the Woods-Saxon one is still relevant, thanks to its computational feasibility and its capability to include shell effects in a simple manner, but it cannot account for many-body effects.
At the moment, there are two competing frameworks that try to tackle the microscopic description of nuclei, (a) the \textit{ab-initio} approach, where the interaction is in principle exact, derived from controlled approximations of quantum chromodynamics; and (b) the use of effective interactions and nuclear Density Functional Theory.

\paragraph{Ab-initio methods}
Ab-initio methods, while technically speaking more rigorous, are still limited as of now, since they can only account for light nuclei or medium-heavy nuclei that can be considered as spherical.
Energy density functionals and effective interactions, such as the Skyrme force, on the other hand are more flexible and less computationally expensive, enabling a much wider representation of nuclei across the whole chart, including heavy nuclei and processes such as fission, fusion, reactions and decays, which are of crucial importance in nuclear engineering.

\paragraph{Density Functional Theory}
D Vautherin and D M Brink laid the foundations of the nuclear Hartree--Fock theory using the Skyrme interaction in 1972 \cite{VauhBrinkOriginal}, through spherically symmetric calculations, which are unable to account for nuclear deformations, essential for nuclei far from magic numbers.
Over the years, thanks to the increase in computational performance of modern hardware, codes that are able to represent more coordinates have been written, mainly using basis expansions on the harmonic oscillator,  which have the downside of not being able to account for near drip line nuclei, due to the diffent asymptotic behaviour of the Gaussian basis in the harmonic oscillator and quasi-resonant states \cite{NDFT}.
Thanks to the flexibility offered by nuclear DFT, it has been chosen in the present work as the framerowk of choice. In particular, using an Energy Density Functional (EDF) derived inspired by the Hartree--Fock expectation value of the Skyrme interaction.

\section{Objective and methods}
The aim of this work is to develop a new implementation of the Hartree--Fock method on an unconstrained 3D mesh, by the use of the Generalised Conjugate Gradient (GCG) method \cite{gcg1}. 
\subsection{Objectives}
The goals addressed by this work are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item demonstrate the feasibility of the Generalised Conjugate Gradient for the solution of large-scale eigenvalue problems;
    \item solve the self-consistent Hartree--Fock equations on an unconstrained 3D mesh;
    \item verify the numerical accuracy of the new implementation, first against existing spherical codes;
    \item second against well established deformed codes; and
    \item attempt to produce novel results that specifically require an unconstrained implementation of this kind, and establish the advance brought to the field by this work.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Methods}
\paragraph{Skyrme Energy Functional}  
The many-body nuclear problem is approached within the Hartree--Fock framework, described in section~\ref{sec:hf}.  
As discussed in chapter \ref{chap:intro}, a pure HF treatment is not sufficient for a quantitative description of nuclear structure, 
and a more general energy density functional (EDF) formulation must be adopted.  
In this work, we employ the Skyrme EDF, whose construction and resulting mean-field equations are developed in section~\ref{sec:skyrme}.  
This provides the self-consistent single-particle Hamiltonian that forms the basis for the numerical treatment.

\paragraph{Finite Differences and Generalised Conjugate Gradient}  
Once the equations to be solved have been derived, their numerical solution requires both a spatial discretization scheme and an efficient solver for the large-scale eigenvalue problem that arises at each iteration of the self-consistent procedure.
\section{Theoretical framework}
The energy functional to be minimised is of the form \cite{Bender2003}
\begin{equation*}
E_{\text{HF}} = \int( \mathcal E_\text{Kin} + \mathcal E_\text{Skyrme} + \mathcal E_\text{Coul})d\bm r.
\end{equation*}
\subsection{Skyrme Functional}
The Skyrme functional formulation used is the following \cite{stevenson2019low}: 
\begin{align*}
    \label{eq:skfunc}
    \mathcal E_\text{Skyrme} = \sum_{t=0,1}\bigg\{ & C_t^\rho [\rho_0]\rho_t^2+C_t^{\Delta \rho}\rho_t\nabla^2\rho_t+\\&+C_t^{\nabla\cdot J}\rho_t\nabla\cdot \mathbf J_t + C_t^\tau\rho_t\tau_t\bigg\}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Coulomb treatment}
Unlike the Skyrme interaction, the Coulomb force is finite-range, giving rise to an unwanted integral operator in the single-particle Hamiltonian.
A well known and widely used device is the Slater approximation \cite{SlaterApp}, which gives a local exchange interaction.
In this approximation, the Coulomb energy reads
\begin{align*}
    E_\text{Coul} = \int \mathcal E_\text{Coul}(\mathbf r) d\bm r
\end{align*}
where the energy density is given by
\begin{align}
    \mathcal E_\text{Coul}(\bm r) = \frac{e^2}{2}\bigg[\int  \frac{\rho_p\rho_p'}{|\mathbf r-\mathbf r'|}d\mathbf r'  - \frac 3 2 \bigg(\frac 3 \pi \bigg) ^{\frac 1 3}\rho_p^{4/3}\bigg].
\end{align}
which results in the Coulomb potential field
\begin{equation}
    U_{C}(\mathbf r) =  \frac{e^2}{2}\bigg[\int \frac{\rho_p(\mathbf r ')}{|\mathbf r-\mathbf r'|} d^3 \mathbf r' - 2\bigg(\frac 3 \pi \bigg) ^{\frac 1 3} \rho_p^{1/3}(\mathbf r ) \bigg]
\end{equation}
Given the proton density, we can impose Dirichlet boundary conditions, which can be extracted from a quadrupole expansion of the charge density \cite{Jackson1998}
\begin{equation}
V_c (\mathbf r) = 4\pi e^2 \sum_{\lambda=0}^2\sum_{\mu=-\lambda}^\lambda \frac{\expval{Q_{\lambda\mu}} Y_{\lambda\mu}}{r^{1+\lambda}}\text{ on }\partial \Omega
\end{equation}
\section{Numerical Implementation}
\subsection{Finite Differences}
Given that the whole equation is linear in $\varphi$, we can evaluate it on the chosen mesh, using finite differences to approximate the differential operators, yielding a linear eigenvalue problem of the form
\begin{align}
    \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N} A_{\alpha\beta}\varphi_{\beta} &= E\varphi_\alpha
\end{align}
where the shorthand notation $N=2\cdot N_x\cdot N_y\cdot N_z$ is used to denote the size of the matrix A, which is $N\times N$.

\subsection{Generalised Conjugate Gradient}
The novel Generalised Conjugate Gradient is implemented \cite{gcg1}.

\section{Original results}
\subsection{$^{20}$Ne clustering}
The formation of clusters in light nuclei has been a research focus object in recent years. The interest stems from different reasons. The formation of clusters at low density is a strong indicator of specific correlations (n-p correlations or alpha-particle, ie `quartetting' correlations) and a strong test for theory. At the same time, clustering may have impact on reactions and astrophysical processes \cite{Lombardo2023}. It has to be noted that cluster formation during fission has been highlighted \cite{Vretenar}. One of the hypothesis is that some light nuclei tend to form clusters of lighter particles, mainly $\alpha$-particles, as to minimise their energy, by displaying `molecular-like' bonds and resonances among the clusters. The phenomenon is not yet understood, with the following results we show that in the framework presented in this work, the formation of clusters is present in $^{20}$Ne.

\begin{equation}
  \tau_q^{\text{TF}}= \frac 3 5 (6\pi^2)^{2/3}\rho_q^{5/3}.
\end{equation}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Near-drip line nuclei}
The need of a mesh representation to account for weakly bound systems has been largely emphasised in previous chapters (see \ref{chap:intro}, \ref{chap:methods}). In this section, results regarding the two nuclei near drip line $^{42}$Si and $^{28}$S are presented, the former being a neutron-rich nucleus, the latter being a proton-rich nucleus. Being weakly bound systems, taking direct measurements of quantities like radii, deformations through spectroscopy etc, is not yet possible. 

We shall compare the experimental neutron $S_n$ or proton $S_p$ separation energy with the theoretical value calculated using Koopmans' theorem \cite{Koopmans1934_Theorem}. The theorem states that in a frozen orbitals approximation, where the mean-field is assumed to remain constant after the removal of a particle, the energy required to remove that particle is equal to the eigenvalue of the last occupied single-particle orbital with an opposite sign.
